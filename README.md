This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## What is this app?

As the name of the repository says it is a todo list, I've already made one[(Go to Repository)](https://github.com/gustavofmota/Simple-to-do-List#to-do-list) but it was too basic and I wanted to get a better understanding of react syntax and hooks.
